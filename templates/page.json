I started Little Green Radicals because for me nothing is truly beautiful unless it is made the right way. From the beginning our clothes have always been organic and Fairtrade, and I am energised by a desire to improve what we make, the way we treat the people who make it and our impact on the environment. <\/p><p><\/p><p>Back in 2005 I designed a set of humorous eco slogan t-shirts and playsuits that gave birth to the company we are today. Not long afterwards, and thankfully for all concerned, I relinquished control of design to the very talented Josie Bragg, who has given Little Green Radicals something that no one else could have imagined. <\/p><p><\/p><p>As we have grown so have I, and I have learned the value of nurturing an inclusive business which encourages work life balance and promotes the ambition of all. My ambition remains for Little Green Radicals to blaze a trail for an ethical fashion revolution. <\/p>",
