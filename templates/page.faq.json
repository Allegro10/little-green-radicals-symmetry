They also receive extra money on top (called a premium) that is used to support the community. It might be used to build a school, or a well – it’s up to them – but little by little Fairtrade farmers see an improvement in their daily lives. The Fairtrade mark on cotton also guarantees working standards throughout the supply chain, including the factory.

No harmful toxins like phthalates, chemical bleaches, harmful heavy metals or chorline are used. <br\/>Our colourful designs are hand screen-printed using either water based inks or a discharge printing method, which uses the same technique but instead of putting a colour on top of the fabric, the colour is removed. <br\/>At Little Green Radicals we make clothes that last from beautiful organic cotton fabrics. Cotton comes in many different forms and we take great joy in using lots of different weaves, from woven yarn dyed seersuckers to soft natural jerseys. These fabrics all have a luxuriously soft hand-feel making them wonderfully comfy for your little one to wear.

Choosing organic is better for your child, better for the planet and better for the health of the farmers.
